            <h2>Live Your Best Life! - Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                He came that you have life abundantly <br>
                You don’t have to be bound, let Him set you free <br>
                You’ve been <span class="highlight1">toiling</span> in the same situation, for too long <br>
                Jesus is the answer and you know it, so how long <br>

                <span class="highlight2">You’re the head,  not the tail</span> <br>

                LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE, come on  <br> <br>

                When you gonna walk in authority like a boss? <br>
                Instead of sitting on the sideline, looking lost <br>
                <span class="highlight2">The Lord God has given you,</span> the green light <br>
                Whatcha waiting for everybody, enjoy your life <br>

                <span class="highlight3">You’re the head,</span> not the tail <br>

                LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE, come on <br> <br>

                It’s good to be alive, but it’s best to live <br> <br>

                That’s what He came for <br>
                <span class="highlight1">Jesus is the door </span><br> 
                Let Him set you free <br>
                He’s your victory <br>
                
                It’s good to be alive, but it’s best to live <br> <br>
            </p>
